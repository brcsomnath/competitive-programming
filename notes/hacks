Zeckendorf’s theorem: Every positive integer can be written in a unique way as a sum of one or more distinct 
Fibonacci numbers such that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

Pisano Period where the last one/last two/last three/last four digit(s) of a Fibonacci number repeats 
with a period of 60/300/1500/15000, respectively.

# Catalan numbers:

Cat(n) = ((2×n)Cn)/(n + 1); Cat(0) = 1
Bottom up DP equation: Cat(m) = 2m×(2m−1) × Cat(m − 1). (m+1)×m

Applications:
1. Cat(n) counts the number of distinct binary trees with n vertices
2. Cat(n) counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses 
which are correctly matched, e.g. for n = 3, we have: ()()(), ()(()), (())(), ((())), and (()()).
3. Cat(n) counts the number of ways a convex polygon (see Section 7.3) of n + 2 sides can be triangulated
4. Cat(n) counts the number of monotonic paths along the edges of an n × n grid, 
which do not pass above the diagonal
